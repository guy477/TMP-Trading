# Trading
Using the Alpaca Markets API alongside the Polygon API this program will take a given ticker symbol, listen to its live data stream, and email me when the TTM Squeeze indicators are triggered.

## ToDo
* when a squeeze 'pops,' trade based on momentum indicator.
* Determine an exit plan.
* Multiple time frames being tracked at once.
* I will be expanding this to add more, different attempts. 

## Updates
* BEEN BUSY; SCHOOL JUST STARTED
* Currently aggregating hour based data for a future idea combining both hour based data and day data.

## Stocks to follow
* ROKU responds well in a 15min timeframe.
