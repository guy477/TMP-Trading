# Trading
Using the Alpaca Markets API alongside the Polygon API this program will watch a stock or stocks in real time and actively utilize the TTM Squeeze Indicator to alert the user through email about significant market activity.

## ToDo
* combine indicators from both hour and 5min (or 15min) based data to minimize false signals.
* Implementing live trading function.
* Multiple time frames being tracked at once.
* I will be expanding this to add more, different attempts. 

## Updates
* Hello. Just debugged alot of the logic and now it functions just as a TTM Squeeze indicator.

## Stocks to follow
* ROKU responds well in a 15min timeframe.
