# Trading
Using the Alpaca Markets API alongside the Polygon API this program will watch a stock or stocks in real time and actively utilize the TTM Squeeze Indicator to alert the user through email about significant market activity.




## ToDo
* Transition over to Day based data
* Implementing live trading function.
* Multiple time frames being tracked at once.
* Debug Hour-based data merging with minute based data (I'm at a loss as to why this happens right now)

## Updates
* Hello. Just debugged alot of the logic and now it functions just as a TTM Squeeze indicator.

## Stocks to follow
* ROKU responds well in a 15min timeframe.
